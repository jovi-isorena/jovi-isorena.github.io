Pseudo code:
1. Let distance of start vertex from start vertex = 0
2. Let distance of other vertices from start = infinity
Repeat
    3. Visit the unvisited vertext with the smallest known distance from the start vertex.
    4. For the current vertex, examine its unvisited neighbors.
    5. For the current vertex, calculate distance of each neighbour from start vertex.
    6. If the calculated distance of a vertex is less than the known distance, update the shortest distance
    7. Update the previous vertex to the list of visited vertices
    8. Add the current vertex to the list of visited vertices
Until all vertices visited

LET distance of start vertex from start vertex = 0
LET distance of all other vertices from start to infinity
WHILE vertices remain unvisited 
    Visit unvisited vertex with smallest known distance from start vertext (call this current vertext)
    FOR EACH unvisited neighbor of the current vertex
        Calculate the distance from start vertex
        IF the calculated distance of this vertex is less than the known distance
            Update shortest distance to this vertex
            Update the previous vertext with the current vertex
        END IF
    NEXT unvisited neighbor
    ADD the current vertex o the list of visited vertices
END WHILE
